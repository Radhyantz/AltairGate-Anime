Thanks for buying this item, since it is a HTML5/CSS3 template it requires no detailed documentation, 
that beign said since most people that buy HTML5 templates have some understanding of HTML, CSS, JS 
coding it should very very very easy for you to get this set up in a static enviroment, if you are a begginer however, 
take this time to learn something new and learn how to create a static website! it will be really awesome and you'll learn alot.

Have Fun and Thanks again.
